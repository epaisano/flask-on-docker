# Flask on Docker


## Overview

This repo is meant to recreate an instagram tech stack. From the tutorial found [here](https://testdriven.io/blog/dockerizing-flask-with-postgres-gunicorn-and-nginx/), we were able to dockerize our Flask app. For production, we used Nginx and Gunicorn. Finally, to test our app, we uploaded our choice of gif, found underneath:
